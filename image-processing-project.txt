The project is supposed to be done in pairs.
The topic is as follows: prepare a few images that are blurred.
You can take some images (e.g. photos) that are already blurred or blur the images using OpenCV.

Then try to fix the images in a few ways.
For instance you can try:
- the gamma transformation,
- various linear and nonlinear filters,
- frequency domain methods (using both Fourier or wavelet transforms),
- ...

Write a short report about the results: which worked beter, in what case, etc.
The deadline for projects: 25th of May 2023.
